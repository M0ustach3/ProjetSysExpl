--------------------------------

## **Important notes**
### Backup
Will ask you for sudo password to open partitions, create directories, mount partitions and open containers. Do not panic.
### SystemChecker
Will not ask you anything, this can be run by a normal user.
### Config
Will ask you for root password to copy files in protected locations (e.g : ```/opt``` for example), create directories and mount partitions. **This is only the case in the PRO config as this config needs to open encrypted partition, this is not the case in the TRAIN and PERSONAL configs**.
### Daemon
Will ask you for root password to copy files in protected locations, reload daemons and start daemons with ```systemctl```.

--------------------------------

## Prerequisites
All the scripts were tested with Xubuntu 18.04 LTS. The system was up-to-date. To ensure that all the scripts will run correctly, you can run this command :
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cryptsetup rsync tar xfconf whiptail thunar libreoffice firefox bc sed
```
**THIS ASSUMES THAT YOU ALREADY INSTALLED VERACRYPT CONSOLE FROM THE OFFICIAL SITE**
